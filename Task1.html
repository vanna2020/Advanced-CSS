    <!-- Task 1 => Explain the purpose of using the var() function in css. Also you
    have created two buttons with id named primaryBtn and secondaryBtn which
    should be given background colors using the var() function. The color code
    for primaryColor is #00b7ff and secondaryColor is #6c757d. -->

    <!-- Ans => The var() function in CSS is used to insert the value of a custom property
    (CSS variable) that you have defined. This makes your styles more reusable
    and easier to maintain because you can define values like colors, spacing,
    or fonts in one place and then use them throughout your stylesheet.

    Purpose of var() function:

    Reusability: You define a value once and use it across multiple elements.
    Maintainability: You can change the value in one place, and all the elements that reference it will automatically update.
    Fallbacks: You can specify a fallback value if the custom property is not defined.

    Example for your buttons:
    You can define the custom properties --primaryColor and --secondaryColor and then use them for the buttons: -->
    <div class="btn-container">
      <button id="primaryBtn">Primary Button</button>
      <button id="secondaryBtn">Secondary Button</button>
    </div>
  </body>
